      Hello, I'm Cindy Wang and I am a sophomore at NEST+m Highschool. I'm passionate about STEM, specifically Computer Science and Engineering with the intersection of business. Ranging from an app, platform, or robot, I aim to help my community by creating something innovative and accessible for all users.
      <br>
      <br>
    Along with my STEM interest, I am extremely passionate about activism. As an activist dedicated to the belief that all individuals deserve basic human rights, I was deeply saddened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. This decision stripped many individuals of their fundamental right to bodily autonomy. I hope that through my website, I can amplify the voices of those who need support and advocate for a future where everyone has the freedom to make their own choices about their bodies and their lives.
